# finalProject
 
This project was created as a final project for a computer science course in grade 11. My teammate and I finished the game in one week. Before beginning the project, I had some experience with Unity, but I had never completed a game. While working on the project, my friend learned everything there is to know about unity. I was responsible for the majority of the work because I had more experience with unity.
